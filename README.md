I am a young computational biologist 👩🏻‍💻, just trying to find her place in the world 🌎

- 🔭 I’m currently working on multiple image-based analysis projects in the [Gregory P. Way lab](https://github.com/WayScience).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to grow my knowledge of Python and R. One of my biggest goals is to improve my biostatistics and machine learning skills.

## My current projects

If you are curious about the projects I am working on, here is a list of the repositories:

1. [NF1 Cell Painting Project](https://github.com/WayScience/nf1_cellpainting_data) - Image analysis and image-based profiling of Schwann cells of different genotypes (wildtype and null), which is used to generate a machine learning model.
2. [CFReT Project](https://github.com/WayScience/CFReT_data) - Image analysis, image-based profiling, and machine learning to predict healthy or failing cell types of cardiac fibroblasts.
3. [Pyroptosis Signature Project](https://github.com/WayScience/pyroptosis_signature) - Image analysis and image-based profiling of PBMCs and SHSY-5Ys to use in cell death prediction. 

### Publications

1. We submitted a preprint for our project titled ["Toward generalizable phenotype prediction from single-cell morphology representations"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.13.584858v1).
This paper describes our work to make a generalizable model predicting phenotype based on nucleus features utilizing the [Mitocheck 2015 labeled dataset](https://www.mitocheck.org/about.shtml).
We applied this model to the [JUMP consortium](https://jump-cellpainting.broadinstitute.org/) and performed a Leave One Image Out analysis, discovering that many features are variable across datasets, leading to problems with generalizability.
We propose different steps to solving this issue within our discussion.
